# urbanopt-ditto-reader
Enhancement of URBANoptâ„¢ GeoJSON that can be consumed by DiTTo reader
More detailed documentation is available on the [URBANopt documentation page](https://docs.urbanopt.net/opendss/opendss.html)

# Installation Pre-requisites
- Python >=3.7

# Installation

`pip install urbanopt-ditto-reader`

# Running the converter

You are expected to have an existing URBANopt project dir with successful simulations of electrical network components before using this package.

## Use the included Command Line Interface:

`ditto_reader_cli -h`

### For help text in the terminal:
`ditto_reader_cli run-opendss -h`

### Example command to run the ditto-reader:
`ditto_reader_cli run-opendss -s <ScenarioFile> -f <FeatureFile>`

### Or build and use a config file (not necessary if using flags like the above example):
`ditto_reader_cli run-opendss -c urbanopt_ditto_reader/example_config.json`

#### If you are using your own config.json file, use the following fields:
1. "urbanopt_scenario_file": Required, Path to scenario csv file
1. "urbanopt_geojson_file": Required, Path to feature json file
1. "equipment_file": Optional, Path to custom equipment file
1. "opendss_folder": Required, Path to dir created by this command, holding openDSS output
1. "use_reopt": Required, Boolean (True/False) to analyze reopt data, if it has been provided
1. "start_time": Optional, String timestamp of the start time of the simulation. Uses format "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS". Cross referenced with the timestamps in the SCENARIO_NAME/opendss/profiles/timestamps.csv file created from profiles in SCENARIO_NAME/FEATURE_ID/feature_reports/feature_report_reopt.csv if use_reopt is true and SCENARIO_NAME/FEATURE_ID/feature_reports/default_feature_report.csv if use_reopt is false. It runs the entire year if the time is not found.
1. "end_time": Optional, String timestamp of the end time of the simulation. Uses format "YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS". Cross referenced with the timestamps in the SCENARIO_NAME/opendss/profiles/timestamps.csv file created from profiles in SCENARIO_NAME/FEATURE_ID/feature_reports/feature_report_reopt.csv if use_reopt is true and SCENARIO_NAME/FEATURE_ID/feature_reports/default_feature_report.csv if use_reopt is false. It runs the entire year if the time is not found.
1. "timestep": Optional, Float number of minutes between each simulation. If smaller than timesteps (or not an even multiple) provided by the reopt feature reports (if use_repot is true), or urbanopt feature reports (if use_reopt is false), an error is raised
1. "upgrade_transformers": Optional, Boolean (True/False). If true, will automatically upgrade transformers that are sized smaller than the sum of the peak loads that it serves. Does not update geojson file - just opendss output files

If either start_time and end_time are invalid or set to None, the simulation will be run for all timepoints provided by the reopt simulation (if use_reopt is true) or urbanopt simulation (if use_reopt is false)
